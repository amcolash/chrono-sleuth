## Ideas

- Town hall meeting each morning
- Time loop
  - "was that a dream?" mechanic
  - maybe influenced by sphinx
- Hotel or inn
  - have to go to sleep each night after fixing part of clock
  - time resets, but progress is kept
  - people forget about you and need to re-introduce - maybe there is one peson on the last day who slips up and says your name, or some small thing to tip you off
- Add more to intro
  - controls intro
  - introduce character instead of just dropping into town

## New TODO

- Find inventor's wrench after puzzle, instead of it being given to you. Once found, he says you can keep it to fix the clock
- Go back and rewrite dialog for day 2 - people forget who you are, but you still remember
  - Day 2/3 town hall meetings get weirder and weirder
